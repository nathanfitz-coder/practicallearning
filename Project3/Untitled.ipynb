    "The custom vocabulary was generated by fitting a logistic regression model to a bag of words matrix as the predictor set, and the binary review sentiment classification as the target variable. The logistic regression model yields coeficients for every word. Words with high possitive coefficients indicate words that have strong possitive sentiment such as \"good\" and \"excellent\". Conversly, words with low negative coefficents indicate words that have strong negative sentiment such as \"poor\" and \"terible\". We are interested in both sets of words. In short, we want words that have the hightest absolute value of their coefficients. Therefore, the top 1000 words with the hightest absolute value were chosen.  "
